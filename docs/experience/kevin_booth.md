## Kevin Booth


<p align="justify">
&emsp; &emsp; Kevin Booth works as a web developer at GYK Antler, a marketing agency which provides branding, video production, web development services, and more. GYK Antler is a mid-sized company with three locations, including one in Manchester. Kevin's job is to work on web maintenance tasks on client sites. He is a Full Stack Web Developer whose job requires knowledge of every part of the websites he creates. Since Kevin had already been though the internship process with GYK Antler and was currently working full-time with them, he completed the applied research option for this course.<br/><br/>

&emsp; &emsp; For three years before his applied research project, GYK Antler had been supporting a small start-up called Explorics which pulls data from dozens of third-party data sources like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and so on. This data is unified into one place, and with the data Explorics can create easily digestible charts and tables for the customer. The relationship between these two companies was very good, and they came to the decision to integrate Explorics data presentation software exclusively with GYK Antler. This is where Kevin's applied research project comes in. Kevin's task was to advance his knowledge of the Explorics platform, as well as to help adapt Explorics software for his companies specific needs.<br/><br/>

&emsp; &emsp; The first thing Kevin needed to do was to familiarize himself with the code base he would be working on. Him and his advisors agreed that the best way to do this would be to identify an area of the program which needed improvement, and to have him work on it. The area they decided to work on was the front-end architecture in their web application, which was a data visualization platform that the company had been licensing for a large fee, which was driving up the cost of the program. Kevin's task would be to learn how the platform worked, as well as how it interacted with the rest of Exploric's software so that he could eventually completely replace it with his own front-end architecture.<br/><br/>

&emsp; &emsp; The first two weeks of the project were spent with Kevin trying to wrap his head around the unfamiliar code by dissecting it, getting a local environment up on his PC, and attending knowledge transfer meetings with the lead software engineer. After this, Kevin met with his supervisor to find a good starting point, which they determined would be developing sub-dashboards. Much of the challenges that Kevin faced were about figuring out what tools he would be utilizing to complete his task, such as which front-end JavaScript framework, charting library, and table library would be the best fit for the project. After implementing these tools, Kevin worked on many other tasks such as validating API security, writing code to make API requests, implementing elements such as pie charts and tables, and much more. By the time the internship class had completed, Kevin had finished the Web sub-dashboard and presented it to the Explorics CEO. Kevin would continue to work on this project after the internship class was over.<br/><br/>

&emsp; &emsp; Due to the amount of freedom Kevin had over the entire project, he ended up learning a lot about self-discipline and project management. He had to set his own personal due dates, which he did not always meet, but which helped keep him on track the entire way through the project. Though he had advisors who assisted him throughout the project, he mostly had to take responsibility into his own hand when it came to setting up meetings and doing research. Even though it was difficult and daunting to go at such a large project mostly on his own, it was greatly beneficial to him as it increased his confidence and taught him a lot about decision making. This also made his work more satisfying, as he knows that something he built by himself will be useful for dozens of other businesses.<br/><br/>
